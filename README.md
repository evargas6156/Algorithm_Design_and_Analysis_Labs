# Algorithm_Design_and_Analysis_Labs
This repository contains all of my labs that were completed for the CSE 100 Algorithm Design 
and Analysis course at the University of California Merced. I completed these labs in Spring 
2020. All of the lab instructions, make files, test cases, and Grader were provided by the 
instructor. I only wrote the files named evargas39.cpp. In order to use the auto grader for
each lab follow the following steps:

1. Open terminal to the desired lab directory.
2. Compile program by using the makefile using command: make
3. Run the grader on the compile program by using command: ./Grade
